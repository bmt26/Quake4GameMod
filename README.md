# Quake4GameMod
## This is a Mod for Quake 4 to turn it into a tower defense style game. To play this game, you need to download the Mod folder from this directory and paste it into your Quake 4 folder

## Changes
* The pistol has been entirely reworked. Instead of firing bullets when using primary fire, it now changes the weapons selected structure of which there are 11. Holding the fire button for the secondary fire will spawn said structure infront of you, if you have enough money.
* There is 1 beacon. The beacon serves as the goal for the enemies, and what you are protecting. The beacon is unable to defend itself and if it dies, you will die. Upon spawn, the beacon will start spawning enemies around itself in waves. These enemies gradually make their way to the beacon.
* There are 5 towers. 
  1. The first 3 are gunners and they have a machine gun, a shotgun, a hyperblaster. 
  1. The next is a medic who can heal you and attacks like normal. 
  1.  The last is a tank that cannot attack, but can take a large amount of damage before dying. All towers can die after enough damage.

  1. The first trap cannot die and is intended to distract enemies.
